## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  ```
  tkinter
  matplotlib
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
   Note: tkinter usually comes with Python installation

### Running the Application
```bash
python chess_coordinates_game.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start a Session**
   - Use the slider to set your preferred practice duration (5-60 seconds)
   - Click "Start" to begin
   - A random coordinate will appear above the board

2. **During Practice**
   - Click the corresponding square on the board
   - Correct moves: Generate new coordinates
   - Incorrect moves: Counted as mistakes
   - Response times are tracked for performance analysis

3. **Game Controls**
   - "Flip Board": Switch between White and Black perspectives
   - "Show Coordinates": Toggle coordinate visibility
   - "Save Stats": Export your progress
   - "Load Stats": Review previous sessions

## üìä Scoring System

The application uses a sophisticated scoring system that considers multiple factors:

- Base score: 100 points per correct click
- Accuracy bonus: Up to 100% of base score
- Speed bonus: Up to 500 points based on response time
- Penalties: -50 points per incorrect click

## üé® Customization

The interface uses a modern color scheme defined in the `COLORS` dictionary:
```python
COLORS = {
    'primary': '#1a365d',     # Dark blue
    'secondary': '#2d3748',   # Dark gray
    'white_square': '#f7fafc', # Light gray-white
    'black_square': '#4a5568', # Medium gray
    'accent': '#3182ce',      # Bright blue
    'text': '#2d3748',        # Dark gray
    'background': '#ffffff'   # White
}
```

## üõ† Technical Details
